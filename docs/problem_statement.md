## Problem Statement

Insider threats in cloud systems occur when authorized users misuse
their access either intentionally or unintentionally.

Traditional cloud security systems mainly focus on external attacks
and often fail to detect abnormal behavior from internal users.

Such threats include unusual login times, unauthorized file access,
and misuse of sensitive data.

This project aims to detect suspicious insider activities by monitoring
user login time and file access patterns using a rule-based approach.
