## Solution Approach

The proposed system monitors user activities in a cloud environment
to identify potential insider threats.

User login times and file access events are collected and analyzed.
Predefined rules are applied to detect abnormal behavior such as:

- Login during unusual hours
- Access to sensitive files without authorization

If any rule is violated, the activity is flagged as suspicious.
This approach provides a simple and effective method to detect
insider threats in cloud systems.
